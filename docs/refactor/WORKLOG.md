# Refactor Worklog

## 2026-07-04

### Done

- Confirmed active execution environment is server 76: `nscc-ds-4a100-node10`.
- Copied `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` into `/data/nfs_shared_data/xxy/aibrix` and read it through section 12.8 before starting remote work.
- Recorded new workspace baseline commit: `adfe6f8373afe5a90a2e93687474f07a0d4aed26`.
- Added upstream remote/tag reference and fetched official `v0.4.0` as `upstream-v0.4.0`.
- Inspected frozen old system at `/root/aibrix-main` without modifying it.
- Created P0 custom diff and interface inventory: `docs/refactor/00_custom_diff_inventory.md`.

### Current State

- P0 inventory is started and contains the major Go/config/Python v1 interface migration surface.
- No local tests/builds are counted.
- No Kubernetes write operations were performed.

### Next

- Capture read-only `kubectl get all -A -o yaml` and `nvidia-smi` snapshots if available.
- Add a simple inventory coverage checker or note exact diff coverage limits.
- Start P1 skeleton/common implementation on server 76 only, using tests as remote verification.

### P0 Snapshot Update

- Captured `nvidia-smi` to `docs/refactor/p0_snapshots/nvidia-smi.txt`.
- Captured `kubectl get pods -A -o wide` to `docs/refactor/p0_snapshots/kubectl_pods_wide.txt` with rc 0.
- Captured `kubectl get all -A -o yaml` to `docs/refactor/p0_snapshots/kubectl_all.yaml` with rc 0.
- These were read-only inspections; no cluster resources were modified.

### Next After P0

- Add/keep a lightweight coverage note for the broad new-workspace upstream drift.
- Commit P0 docs and snapshots.
- Start P1 in the remote workspace only.

### P0 Verification Update

- Added `docs/refactor/00_p0_verification.md`.
- P0 is ready to commit as documentation/snapshot work.
- No local tests or local build outputs were used.


### P1 Common Skeleton

- Added remote-only P1 `tre/common` package with registry, Redis key, metrics schema, percentile, and JSON logging helpers.
- Added `tre/deploy/registry.yaml` from frozen old manifests/profile defaults for `dsqwen-7b`, `dsllama-8b`, and `dsqwen-14b`.
- Added `tre/deploy/gen_model_manifests.py` and generated per-slot model Deployment manifests.
- Added `tre/Makefile` with `check`, `smoke`, and `manifests` targets.
- Verification recorded in `docs/refactor/01_p1_verification.md`.


### P2 Inspection Start

- Inspected new gateway queue-router, SLO router construction, request-body availability check, and old frozen queue wake-up code.
- Found target-version behavior difference: new gateway rejects zero-routable models before queue-router wake-up can run.
- Created `docs/refactor/02_upstream_patches.md` with the P2 gateway/APA patch map.


### P2 Gateway Wake-Up Dispatcher

- Added RED tests for `callWakeUpService`: missing `SERVEMENT_URL` must fail, configured URL must receive POST `/wake_up` with `model_name`, normalized `kind`, and `queue_len`.
- RED result used `/usr/local/go/bin/go` and `GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct`; the test failed because `callWakeUpService` was undefined.
- Added `pkg/plugins/gateway/algorithms/wakeup.go` for `TRE-PATCH(P2-GW-001)` with service-manager URL sourced only from `SERVEMENT_URL` and no hard-coded fallback.
- Verified `go test ./pkg/plugins/gateway/... -count=1` passed on server 76 with the regional Go proxy.
- Next P2 slice: wire zero-routable request handling in `gateway_req_body.go` to submit a wake-up request before returning 503.
