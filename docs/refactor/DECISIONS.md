# Refactor Decisions

## ADR-0001: Remote server 76 is authoritative

- Date: 2026-07-04
- Status: accepted

### Context

`REFACTOR_PLAN.md` states that all new code changes and tests happen in `/data/nfs_shared_data/xxy/aibrix` on server 76. The local Windows checkout is not authoritative.

### Decision

All implementation and verification must happen in `/data/nfs_shared_data/xxy/aibrix` on server 76. Local test/build output is ignored. Local work may only be used as a disposable draft source and must be re-applied/verified remotely.

### Consequences

P1 work drafted locally is not considered complete until created and verified on server 76. P0 inventory and subsequent docs in this directory are authoritative.

## ADR-0002: Record baseline commit instead of creating `baseline-v0` tag immediately

- Date: 2026-07-04
- Status: accepted

### Context

P0 allows either tagging `baseline-v0` or recording the baseline commit in WORKLOG. The remote workspace has an untracked `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` at the start of work.

### Decision

Record baseline commit `adfe6f8373afe5a90a2e93687474f07a0d4aed26` in P0 docs and WORKLOG. Defer creating phase tags until the first clean phase commit.

### Consequences

This avoids tagging a state before the refactor plan/documentation commit exists. The baseline is still recoverable by commit hash.
